# Learning Log

This repository contains the Learning Log web application project from the book *Python Crash Course*
by Eric Matthes.

## Description

Learning Log is a simple web application built using Django. The purpose of the app is to provide a
platform where users can log the topics they are learning about and make entries for each topic. It
serves as a learning diary, allowing users to keep track of their progress and revisit past entries.

### Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register, log in, and log out.
- **Topics Management:** Users can create new topics, view existing ones, and delete them.
- **Entries Management:** For each topic, users can add entries, edit them, and delete them.
- **Admin Interface:** An admin interface to manage the topics and entries more efficiently.

## Usage

To use the Learning Log application, you can clone the repository and explore the code to understand
how a Django project is structured. The main components of the application include:

- **Models:** Define the database structure for topics and entries.
- **Views:** Handle the logic for displaying pages and processing user input.
- **Templates:** HTML files that define the layout and structure of the web pages.
- **Forms:** Used for creating and editing topics and entries.
